# YouTube Buddy
A friendly YouTube Buddy that lets you know when your favorite channels have uploaded a new video.

- Receive email notifications with direct links when your favorite channels upload new content, without ever having to lose yourself in the YouTube home page. 
- On macOS, take your data privacy a step further by using the ad-free and tracker-free Duck Player with the [DuckDuckGo Web Browser](https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-duckduckgo-for-mac/).
